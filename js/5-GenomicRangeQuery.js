// A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G and T,
// which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide
// has an impact factor, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types A, C, G and T have
// impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going to answer several
// queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained
// in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?
//
// The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N characters.
// There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers.
// The K-th query (0 â‰¤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides
// contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).
//
// For example, consider string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:
//
//   P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
//   P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
//   P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6
// The answers to these M = 3 queries are as follows:
//
// The part of the DNA between positions 2 and 4 contains nucleotides G and C (twice),
// whose impact factors are 3 and 2 respectively, so the answer is 2.
// The part between positions 5 and 5 contains a single nucleotide T, whose impact factor is 4,
// so the answer is 4.
// The part between positions 0 and 6 (the whole string) contains all nucleotides,
// in particular nucleotide A whose impact factor is 1, so the answer is 1.
// Write a function:
//
// function solution(S, P, Q);
// that, given a non-empty zero-indexed string S consisting of N characters and two non-empty
// zero-indexed arrays P and Q consisting of M integers, returns an array consisting of M
// integers specifying the consecutive answers to all queries.
//
// For example, given the string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:
//
//     P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
//     P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
//     P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6
// the function should return the values [2, 4, 1], as explained above.
